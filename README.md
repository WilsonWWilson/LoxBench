# LoxBench
Playground to test functions and features of Loxone

For now the main focus lies on the security aspect.
This repo will contain several scripts to help with the discovery of the attack surface, potential weaknesses and shortcomings in the implementations on the Miniserver.
At some point the scope may be extended to the Loxone Config software or services and other applications for the Loxone environment.
