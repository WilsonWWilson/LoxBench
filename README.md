# LoxBench
Playground to test functions and features of Loxone.

For now the main focus lies on the security of the Miniserver and its interfaces.
This repo will contain several scripts to help with:
 - the discovery of the attack surface (e.g. undocumented API functions)
 - evaluation of the cryptographic components (e.g. authentication, tokens, update signing)
 - potential weaknesses and shortcomings in the design and implementations of features

At some point the scope may be extended to the Loxone Config software or services and other applications for the Loxone environment.
